Godot 4 is a powerful and open-source game engine that's perfect for developers of all skill levels. In this blog post, we'll walk through the steps of creating a basic 2D game in Godot 4, perfect for beginners.

## Introduction to Godot 4

Godot 4 is the latest version of the Godot game engine, known for its user-friendly interface and versatile functionality. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, Godot 4 offers an accessible platform for game development.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

## Step 2: Understanding the Interface

Familiarize yousrself with the Godot interface. The main areas include the Scene Panel, where you'll build your game scenes; the Inspector, for adjusting the properties of selected objects; and the FileSystem, where all your project's files are managed.

## Step 3: Creating Your First Scene

A scene in Godot is a collection of elements like sprites, sounds, and scripts. Create your first scene by selecting 'Scene' -> 'New Scene'. Add a Node2D as your root node, which will act as the container for your game objects.

## Step 4: Adding Sprites and Characters

To add a character or object to your scene, you'll need to add a Sprite node. Download or create a simple 2D character sprite and import it into Godot. Then, drag and drop the sprite file onto your Sprite node in the scene.

## Step 5: Basic Scripting

Godot uses GDScript, a Python-like language, for scripting game logic. To add behavior to your character, right-click on the Sprite node and select 'Attach Script'. In the script editor, you can write simple commands to control the character's actions.

## Step 6: Running Your Game

To see your game in action, click the 'Play' button at the top of the screen. If you haven't set a main scene yet, Godot will prompt you to select one. Choose your newly created scene and watch your character come to life!
